# Active.Us API

#### _An API that is designed to help individuals connect with nonprofits in the Portland metro area._, {September 6, 2018}_

### By Masen Matthews

## Description / Motivation
  Active.us is an API that features information about local nonprofits in Portland. I started this project during my last week at Epicodus (May 2018) and have been pretty hands-off with it since then. Now that I've finished the internship portion of Epicodus, I'm looking forward to jumping back in. 
  
  This was originally being developed with a Rails frontend, which has since been scrapped. I may build a front end portion in the future using React. Regardless, I feel that an API like this one could be utilized by a lot of developers who are interested in using tech as a means of creating positive social changes. 
  
  As a person with a background in sociology, I feel inclined to use my technical skill in a way that benefits the world around me. This is essentially my way of giving back and I hope that it can grow into something that gets utilized by a wide variety of users.
  
## Current status / future expansion
  I'm in the early stages of getting back to working on this API. Next steps will include adding token authentication and building out the actual database of nonprofits. Stay tuned!
